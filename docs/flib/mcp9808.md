# MCP9808 I2C temperature sensor driver

[code]: i2c/mcp9808.fs (i2c)
* Code: [mcp9808.fs](https://github.com/jeelabs/embello/tree/master/explore/1608-forth/flib/i2c/mcp9808.fs)
* Needs: i2c

This is an I2C driver for the Microchip MCP9808 temperature sensor.

### API

To initialize the chip and the driver `mcp9808-init` must be
called. This places the chip in continuous conversion mode with 0.125C
resolution. `mcp9808-data` returns the result of the last conversion as
a 32-bit integer representing 1/100th degrees centigrade (rounded).

[defs]: <> (mcp9808-init mcp9808-data)
```
: bme-init ( -- nak )
: bme-calib ( -- )
```

For low power operation (e.g. battery) the chip can be put to sleep
and woken up when a conversion is desired. Start with `mcp9808-sleep`
and when a conversion is desired, use `mcp9808-convert` to initiate a
conversion. It returns the number of milliseconds to wait before the
conversion data can be retrieved using `mcp9808-data`. Then place the
chip to sleep again using `mcp9808-sleep`.  Note that `mcp9808-convert`
places the chip into continuous conversion mode so `mcp9808-sleep`
is required, there is no single-shot conversion mode in this chip.

[defs]: <> (mcp9808-sleep mcp9808-convert)
```
: bme-data ( -- )  \ get a sensor reading from the BME280
: bme-calc ( -- h p t )  \ convert reading to calibrated values
```

### Constants

The I2C address is hard-coded as `$18`.
