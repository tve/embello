\ record messages into SPI Flash memory using the smem driver.

\ Assumes that flash consists of 4KB erasable sectors and 256 byte pages.
\ Supports writing up to 255 byte long messages (not 256!). Writes them using a length header
\ byte followed by the data

0 variable next-addr \ next address to store/retrieve message
0 variable size-mask \ memory size -1 to use as mask

\ ===== special smem primitives to handle writing of length byte separately from following buffer

[ifndef] >smem-start \ allow redefinition of smem primitives for testing purposes

: >smem-start ( hdr flash-addr -- ) \ start write to flash address and push header
  smem-wait $06 smem-cmd -spi \ wait-ready, write-enable command
  $02 smem-cmd-addr ( hdr spi-sr )
  spi-rxdrop spi-push ( spi-sr ) \ write hdr
  ;

: >smem-buf ( addr len -- ) \ push buffer to flash and end spi transaction
  >spi.N drop -spi ; \ write the buffer

[then]

\ ===== helpers

: xs? ( len -- f ) \ crossing into the next sector? (or filling current one)

: page-left ( -- n ) \ number of bytes left in page

: erase-next ( -- ) \ erase sector after the current being filled, needs to wrap-around
  next-addr @ $fff or 1+ smem-size 1- and 8 rshift smem-erase ; \ 16 pages per sector

: wrap ( flash-addr -- flash-addr ) \ wraps flash address around end

: next-sect ( flash-addr -- flash-addr ) \ move up to start of next sector with wrap
  $fff or 1+ wrap ;

\ ===== recording

: rec-buf ( addr len -- ) \ record buffer to flash at current next-addr (helper)

  page-left 2dup >= if ( addr len left ) \ crossing into next page? (>= due to len prefix)

\ ===== playback
